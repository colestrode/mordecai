Here is a brand style guide derived from the "Manager's Mark" image, structured according to your example format.

As a Sr. UX Designer, my assessment of this mark is that it establishes a very specific tone: intense, industrial, authoritative, and high-contrast. It suggests a digital interface overlaid on a brutal, physical reality. The style guide below aims to translate that intensity into usable UI components without overwhelming the user.

# Brand Style Guide: The Manager's Mark

## 1.0 The Logo

The core of our brand identity is "The Manager's Mark." It is a symbol of absolute authority within the System. It combines brutalist physical textures with intense digital luminescence.

### 1.1 Primary Logo

The primary logo consists of a heavily cracked, concrete-textured capital letter 'M', enclosed within a glowing, neon-red hexagonal border.

* **Usage:** This mark is intended for high-impact areas: splash screens, headers, and major branding moments.
* **Clearance:** Always maintain minimum clear space around the logo equivalent to 50% of the hexagon's height. Nothing should crowd the glow.
* **Backgrounds:** The logo is designed exclusively for dark backgrounds (preferably pure black) to maximize the neon effect. Do not place on light or noisy backgrounds.

### 1.2 Iconography Concepts

When translating the brand into smaller UI elements where the full texture won't read, we lean into the shape and color.

* **Containers:** The hexagon is our primary container shape for avatars, badges, or critical alerts.
* **Standard Icons:** UI icons (settings, menu, etc.) should be mono-weight, angular, and utilize the System Red color. avoid rounded corners; prioritize sharp angles.

## 2.0 Colors

Our palette is stark and high-contrast. It relies heavily on pure black to make our primary "System Red" feel incandescent. The greys are pulled directly from the stone texture of the mark.

| Color | Name | Hex | RGB | CMYK | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | **System Red** | `#FF0000` | 255, 0, 0 | 0, 100, 100, 0 | Primary brand color, CTAs, glowing borders, critical alerts. |
|  | **Void Black** | `#000000` | 0, 0, 0 | 60, 40, 40, 100 | Primary background color. The canvas. |
|  | **Deep Charcoal** | `#1A1A1A` | 26, 26, 26 | 0, 0, 0, 90 | Secondary backgrounds, cards, or modal surfaces to differentiate from the Void. |
|  | **Concrete Grey** | `#808080` | 128, 128, 128 | 0, 0, 0, 50 | Secondary text, inactive states, subtle borders. |
|  | **System White** | `#E6E6E6` | 230, 230, 230 | 0, 0, 0, 10 | Primary typography for maximum readability against black. Avoid pure #FFFFFF as it can be jarring. |

### 2.1 Effects: Neon Glow

The "System Red" is rarely flat. To mimic the source image, active elements should utilize an outer glow (box-shadow in CSS).

* **Standard Glow CSS:** `box-shadow: 0 0 10px #FF0000, 0 0 20px #FF0000;`

## 3.0 Typography

To balance the heavy, cracked texture of the 'M', our typography must be clean, modern, and highly legible, while retaining a sense of strength.

**Primary Typeface: Inter**
We chose Inter for its excellent readability on screens and its neutral, yet strong, geometric qualities.

### 3.1 Type Hierarchy

**Headline 1 (Page Titles)**

* Font: Inter Black (900) or Extra Bold (800)
* Color: System White (or System Red for emphasis)
* Case: Uppercase meant for impact.

**Headline 2 (Section Headers)**

* Font: Inter Bold (700)
* Color: System White

**Body Copy**

* Font: Inter Regular (400)
* Color: System White (for primary reading) or Concrete Grey (for secondary info)
* *Note: Ensure high contrast ratios for accessibility.*

**Data/System Text**

* Font: 'Roboto Mono' or similar monospace font.
* Usage: Used for displaying stats, code, or "system messages."

## 4.0 Textures and Imagery

The brand relies on the tension between the digital and the physical.

### 4.1 Concrete Texture

The cracked stone texture from the 'M' should be used sparingly as an accent texture. It can be used as a subtle overlay on header backgrounds or muted way down in opacity on cards. It should never interfere with text readability.

### 4.2 The Hexagon Motif

The hexagonal shape of the red border is our defining geometric element.

* **UI Components:** Buttons, input fields, and image frames should avoid soft, rounded radii. Use sharp 90-degree corners or beveled/chamfered corners that mimic hexagonal geometry.
